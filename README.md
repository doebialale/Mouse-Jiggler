# Mouse-Jiggler

This is a Powershell script that turns on and off the scroll lock on your keyboard. The idea is to prevent your computer from sleeping. To use this script, do the following:
1. Download the MouseJigglerPowershell.ps1 file
2. Right-click on it and select "Run with Powershell".

This script is designed to turn on and turn off the virtual Scroll Lock  button every 2 minutes. However, you can change the time and the command to something else. For example, you can change it from selecting the virtual Scroll Lock to selecting the virtual Caps Lock instead. That way, you can see the Caps Lock on your keyboard light up when the script is executed. You can also change the time to 1 second so that you do not have to wait for 2 minutes.

Happy Jiggling!!!
