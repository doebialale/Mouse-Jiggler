This is a Powershell script that turns on and off the scroll lock on your keyboard. The idea is to prevent your computer from sleeping. To use this code, right-click on the file after downloading it, and select "Run with Powershell".

The script would run toggle the virtual scroll lock button every 2 minutes. You can change the time and the command to something else. For example, you can change it from selecting Scroll Lock and select to Caps Lock instead so that you can see your keyboard light up when the script is executed. You can also change the time to 1 second so that you do not have to wait for 2 minutes.
